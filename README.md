# Task-Schedular
This program simulates various task scheduling algorithms using C. It reads task specifications from an input file (`TaskSpec.txt`), applies four different scheduling algorithms (FCFS, RR, NSJF, and PSJF), and writes the results, including waiting times and average waiting times, to an output file (`Output.txt`).
